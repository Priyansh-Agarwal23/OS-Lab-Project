                In this algorithm, OS replaces the page that will not be used for the longest period of time in future.<br><br>
                <b>Important points about Optimal page replacement algorithm:</b><br>
                1. The consequence of the revelation of Belady’s Anamoly.<br>
                2. Most reduced page fault rate of all algorithms and will never suffer from
                Belady’s Anamoly.<br>
                3. Just it replaces the pages that won’t be utilized for the longest time frame.<br>
                4. Optimal page replacement is accurate as possible required, but not possible
                in practice as the operating system cannot know future requests.<br>
                5. The utilization of optimal Page replacement is to set up a benchmark so that
                other replacement algorithms can be analyzed against it.

                <li>It is free from Belady’s Anamoly.</li>
                <li>Most reduced page fault rate</li>
                <li>Twice tantamount to FIFO Page Replacement Algorithm</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Optimal Page Replacement is not possible in practice as the operating system cannot know future requests. The use of Optimal Page replacement is to set up a benchmark so that other replacement algorithms can be analyzed against it.</li>
                <li>It is hard to execute</li>
