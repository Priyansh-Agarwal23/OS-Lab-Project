        <h3>Theory</h3>
        <div>
            <p class ="algo1para">This is the Last in First Out algorithm and works on LIFO principles. In this algorithm, the newest page is replaced by the requested page. Usually, this is done through a stack, where we maintain a stack of pages currently in the memory with the newest page being at the top. Whenever a page fault occurs, the page at the top of the stack is replaced.<br>LIFO works on the principle of “Last in First out“.It replaces the newest page that arrived at last in the main memory.It is implemented by keeping track of all the pages in a stack.</p>

            <p class ="algo1para2">Advantages of LIFO</p>
            <ul>
                <li> Simple to understand</li>
                <li> Easy to implement</li>
                <li>No overhead</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="algo1para2">Disadvantages of LIFO</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Does not consider Locality principle, hence may produce worst performance</li>
                <li>The old pages may reside in memory forever even if they are not used</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Example</h3>
            <p class="LIFO-question">Let’s see how the LIFO performs for our example string of 3, 1, 2, 1, 6, 5, 1, 3 with 3-page frames :</p>

            <div>
                <ol>
                    <li>Initially, since all the slots are empty, page 3,1,2 causes a page fault and takes the empty slots.
                        Page faults = 3 </li>
                    <li>When page 1 comes, it is in the memory and no page fault occurs.<br>
                        Page faults = 3
                         </li>
                    <li>When page 6 comes, the page fault occurs and page 2 is removed as it is on the top of the stack and is the newest page.<br>
                        Page faults = 4 </li>
                    <li>When page 5 comes, it is not in the memory, which causes a page fault, and
                        hence page 6 is removed being on top of the stack.<br>
                        Page faults = 5 </li>
                    <li>When page 1 and page 3 come, they are in memory already, hence no page
                        fault occurs.<br>
                        Total page faults = 5 </li>
